h4. Ideas to Incorporate

h4. Story

Customer sends email to request cancellation of an order. CSR reviews email, finds the order, and if it has not shipped (shipment packed) then records the order as cancelled. If payment has been received for the order Company automatically refunds the payment. If the order has shipped CSR replies to customer by email to notify that the item has been shipped and they are liable to pay.

Customer reviews order online and if any of it has not been shipped a cancel button will be available for the entire order and each item that has not shipped. Customer cancels entire order or individual item. Company automatically changes status, cancels inventory reservation(s), and if payment has been received then refunds payment.
