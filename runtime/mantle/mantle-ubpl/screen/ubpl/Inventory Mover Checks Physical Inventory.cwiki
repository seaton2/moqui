h4. Story

Inventory Mover receives a list of stock locations scheduled to be checked, sorted by least-recently-checked location first, and then by facility location code. Locations with an outstanding pick or stock move will be removed from the list. System will track outstanding stock checks by location and not issue picks or stock moves for those locations until the stock check is recorded. Outstanding picks, moves, and stock checks have a timeout, and are cleared at the end of the day. Inventory Mover records the actual quantity at each location, causing a record of variance to be created if the currently recorded quantity for that location is different than the actual quantity recorded by Inventory Mover.
