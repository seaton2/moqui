h1. Marketer Maintains General Site Content

h4. Story

Marketer writes copy and creates or gathers images to be included in the public facing web site. Marketer reviews list of existing content on the site (associated with named placeholders or content managed pages) and finds the content to update with the new text and/or images. Marketer uploads images and edits or pastes text to modify the selected content.

If there is no existing content on the site and Marketer wants to add content to an existing dynamic page Marketer contacts Developer to add a placeholder.

If there is no existing content on the site and Marketer wants to create a new content managed page Marketer adds page, selecting the desired decorator screen so that common parts look the same as other pages. Marketer adds content to the page as desired.
