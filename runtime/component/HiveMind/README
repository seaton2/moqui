HiveMind PM
===========

HiveMind PM is a project management application featuring project/task,
request, and content (wiki) management. There is support for multiple
vendors, multiple clients, flexible billing rates, time recording,
expenses, invoicing, payments, and general ledger.

To run HiveMind you need Moqui Framework and Mantle Business Artifacts as
well as HiveMind itself. Moqui supports a few methods for setup and
deployment as described in the documentation here:

http://www.moqui.org/framework/docs/RunDeploy.html

The easiest way to try HiveMind is with the preview distribution from Moqui
which is available here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/moqui/files/release-1.3.1/moqui-1.3.1-mantle-HiveMind-preview.zip/download

To get the latest Moqui, Mantle, and HiveMind and run locally you'll need
JDK 1.6 or later, Gradle 1.6, and either a git client or you can use the
"ZIP" download links on each project page on github. The github project
pages are at:

https://github.com/jonesde/moqui
https://github.com/jonesde/mantle
https://github.com/jonesde/HiveMind

Java can be downloaded here (make sure to use the Download button under
the "JDK" column, not the under the "JRE" column):

Gradle can be downloaded here:

To download Moqui/Mantle/HiveMind source and build/run locally use the
following steps:

1. Download Moqui Framework

Zip: https://github.com/jonesde/moqui/archive/master.zip
Git: git://github.com/jonesde/moqui.git

From either source you should have a "moqui" directory for the next steps.
If you use the Zip download change the directory name from "moqui-master"
to "moqui".

2. Download Mantle Business Artifacts

Zip: https://github.com/jonesde/mantle/archive/master.zip
Git: git://github.com/jonesde/mantle.git

Put the "mantle" directory in the "moqui/runtime" directory so it is
located at "moqui/runtime/mantle". If you use the Zip download change the
name of the directory from "mantle-master" to "mantle" to make sure the
directory under the "moqui/runtime" directory has the correct name.

3. Download HiveMind PM

Zip: https://github.com/jonesde/HiveMind/archive/master.zip
Git: git://github.com/jonesde/HiveMind.git

Put the "HiveMind" directory in the "moqui/runtime/component" directory so
it is located at "moqui/runtime/component/HiveMind". If you use the Zip
download change the name of the directory from "HiveMind-master" to
"HiveMind" to make sure the directory under the "moqui/runtime/component"
directory has the correct name.

4. Build and load seed and demo data

From the "moqui" directory run "gradle load".

This will build Moqui and load data from Moqui, Mantle and HiveMind into
an embedded Derby database.

5. Run Moqui

From the "moqui" directory run "gradle run".
