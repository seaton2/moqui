                Whenever an email message is received the actions will be run if the condition is met.

                The context for the condition and actions will include a "headers" Map with all of the
                email headers in it (either String, or List of String if there are more than one of the header), and a
                "fields" Map with the following: toList, ccList, bccList, from, subject, sentDate, receivedDate,
                bodyPartList.
